        <h1>These are my attempts at practicing servelets</h1>
        <h2>Wow what can I say what a read this is a really long chapter
            and takes quite a few rereads to get a basic understanding</h2>
        <p>Without the help Netbeans provided I am not sure how well I would be
            able to get this to work.Also having a example to see what was what
            really helped.I think I will need to see more of this in practice to
            fully understand it.</p>
